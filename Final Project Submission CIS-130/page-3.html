                  <li class="list-group-item">One of my biggest personal projects that I work upon is a worldbuilding and story project that I have collected and worked on
                  for the better part of a few years, starting out as a collection of random concepts that I would think of and collect them all together
                  before coming up with how best to think of how to implement them all. The story concept is something that I plan to have for some future major project,
                  whether that be a novel or even a game concept, depending on how things play out in that venture. I am always excited to keep adding onto it and all
                  as a personal passion project of mine.</li>
