              <h5 class="card-title">My Academic Accomplishments</h5>
              <p class="card-text lead"> As far as my academic accomplishments, I would list out the following:</p>
              <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                <li class="list-group-item">Classes within my field of study have been in a wide variety of topics regarding Information Technology, including
                SQL and databasing, cloud computing, programming in several languages, along with more elective courses in between like
                international politics, history and English.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Throughout my tenure as a student, I have been involved in a lot of class related projects in preparation and to properly learn
                all of the skills and talents needed for the IT department, including but not limited to creating an SQL database and data model, certifying in managing an
                Amazon AWS cloud computing server, and numerous applications of coding, including this very website, where I demonstrate the various lessons I learned in my
                web development class, such as media viewports to edit sites for mobile views, grids and flexboxes, validation of both HTML5
                and CSS in order to make sure they work as best as they can in everyone's browsers, and proper layout and style design in CSS to name a few.
                Overall, it was an amazing experience and it was incredible to see how far I have come in regards to how I have improved my craft since my first website submission
                in CIS-130.</li>
